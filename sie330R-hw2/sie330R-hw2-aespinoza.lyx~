Homework 2 (Chapter 2)
\end_layout

Homework must be readable! Do not just send in numbers or charts.
 You must explain the homework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
answers Preferred to receive homework in Word doc format with any excel
 or Minitab results pasted
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
into word document.
 You may choose to use pdf which is also OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Put answers to all questions in one document NOT in separate documents

\begin_layout Enumerate
Which of the following is a valid Null Hypothesis?
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ho: p>0.7
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ho: n=10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A valid null hypothesis is option A, Ho: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

=10.
 This is becasue option A is the only null hypothesis that includes a mean
 equal to, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to a value.

\begin_layout Enumerate
A school district believes that the average score for a particular math
 class is 85.
 The null and alternative hypotheses being tested are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Ho: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 ≥ 85
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
H1:

\end_inset

 < 85
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In plain English describe the outcome of a Type I Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is ture and rejected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In plain English describe the outcome of a Type II Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false and not rejected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In plain English describe a correct decision
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A correct decision occurs when the null hypothesis is ture and not rejected,
 and when it is false and rejected.

\begin_layout Enumerate
A particular snack brand is advertised that each package contains 454 grams.
 It is suspected that the packaging machine is off and on the average each
 package contains less.
 A large sample is taken in order to test the hypotheses:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Ho: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 ≥ 454
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ha: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 < 454
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The P-value is calculated as 0.09.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which of the following would be a correct interpretation of the P-value?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It can conclusively be stated that the packaging machine is working correctly
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is a 9% probability that the exact fill weight average is 454 g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The probability of obtaining a sample mean as extreme as the one observed
 given that the true mean is exactly 454 g is 0.09, or 9%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
There is a 9% probability that the alternative hypothesis is true, that
 the mean fill rate is less than 454 g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
9% of the sample was less than 454 g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Because the P-value is greater than 5%, the correct interpretation of the
 calculated P-value would be to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., option D
\emph default
: there is a 9% probability that the alternative hypothesis is true, that
 the mean fill rate is less than 454 g.
\emph on

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Bureau of Labor Statistics would like an estimate of the average age
 of workers in a particular field.
 50 people are sampled and their ages are recorded.
 The 95% Confidence Interval is calculated as being {33.0, 39.8} 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

What is the correct interpretation of this Confidence Interval?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The true average age of workers will fall between 33.0 and 39.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
95% of all people in this field are between 33 and 39.8 years old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If 100 samples are taken of this population using this same method and then
 the Confidence Interval of each are calculated, about 95 of the intervals
 will contain the true population mean value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is a 95% probability that the true average is between 33 and 39.8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Because the 95% CI is the probability of the mean falling between the given
 interval, 33.0 and 39.8, the correct interpretation for this CI is option
 C, if 100 samples are taken of this population using this same method and
 then the Confidence Interval of each are calculated, about 95 of the intervals
 will contain the true population mean value.
